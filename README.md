## Intro

Magento is an open source e-commerce platform. It can be used as an online shop for selling personalized products and designs using [ZetaPrints web-to-print and image generation API](http://www.zetaprints.com/help/category/api/). The extension syncs the data between the two apps in a way that all processes are hosted within Magento interface, even if they are executed by ZetaPrints.
